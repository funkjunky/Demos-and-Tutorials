These are mostly OpenGL tutorials and presentations. During my time at the U I had done 3 tutorials on OpenGL. The last one I did was the breakout one, which didn't include a slideshow. Instead I attempted to program it from scratch in front of everyone, which I realized afterwards was impossible in one session.

I learned a lot from these presentations.

The flash one is just me trying out flash and putting down my thoughts about it.
